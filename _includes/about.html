                    <p style = "font-size: 20px;">Your professional bio is, arguably, the most important piece of copy you’ll ever write about yourself. It’s the first introduction to who you are, what you do, and what you’re interested in—whether a blurb on a social media platform, a personal website, or company team page. What you choose to highlight may play a role in others deciding to follow you, call you in for an interview, or invite you to participate in an event. It’s an opportunity for you to—in a few lines—showcase your work, competence, and areas of expertise. In short, it’s the first look at your personality. </p>
